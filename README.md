Creating location-based apps in Morocco can be tricky, especially when accurately mapping the country's borders, including the Sahara desert. Many developers have suggested solutions like hiding borders or fixing regions, but these methods can disrupt user experience.

Instead of a detailed tutorial, I've created a sample app using Tile Overlay in iOS 7 to easily customize MapKit for accurate mapping of Morocco. You can find the code on my GitHub.

Check out the Custom Map class example to see what we've achieved.

To understand Tile Overlay better, I recommend NSHipster's article on MKTileOverlay and MKMapSnapshotter.

Thanks for exploring this with me!
